    "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Firefly par Ed Sheeran\r\nI fell in love next to you\nBurning fires in this room\nIt just fits, light and smooth\nLike my feet in my shoes\nLittle one, lie with me\nSew you heart to my sleeve\nWe'll stay quiet underneath\nShooting stars, if it helps you sleep\n\nAnd hold me tight, don't let me breathe\nFeeling like you won't believe\n\nThere's a firefly loose tonight\nBetter catch it before it burns this place down\nAnd I lie if I don't feel so right\nBut the world looks better through your eyes\n\nThere's a firefly loose tonight\nBetter catch it before it burns this place down\nAnd I lie if I don't feel so right\nBut the world looks better through your eyes\n\nTeach my skin those new tricks\nWarm me up with your lips\nHeart to heart, melt me down\nIt's too cold in this town\nClose your eyes, lean on me\nFace to mouth, lips to cheek\nFeeling numb in my feet\nYou're the one to help me get to sleep\n\nAnd hold me tight, don't let me breathe\nFeeling like you won't believe\n\nThere's a firefly loose tonight\n\nBetter catch it before it burns this place down\nAnd I lie if I don't feel so right\nBut the world looks better through your eyes\nThere's a firefly loose tonight\nBetter catch it before it burns this place down\nAnd I lie if I don't feel so right\nBut the world looks better through your eyes\n\nIt's only been one night of love\nAnd maybe that is not enough\nHold me tight, don't let me breathe\nFeeling like you won't believe\nOnly been one night of love\nMaybe that is not enough\nHold me tight, don't let me breathe\nFeeling like you won't believe\n\nThere's a firefly loose tonight\n\nBetter catch it before it burns this place down\nAnd I lie if I don't feel so right\nBut the world looks better through your eyes\nThere's a firefly loose tonight\nBetter catch it before it burns this place down\nAnd I lie if I don't feel so right\nBut the world looks better through your eyes"
