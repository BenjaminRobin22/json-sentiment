    "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Thank You par Dido\r\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I \ngot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window, \nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'd all be grey \nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad\nIt's not so bad\n\nI drank too much last night, got bills to pay\nMy head just feels in pain\nI missed the bus and there'll be hell today\nI'm late for work again\nAnd even if I'm there, they'll all imply \nThat I might not last the day\nAnd then you call me and it's not so bad\n\nIt's not so bad\n\nI want to thank you\nFor giving me the best day of my life\nOh, just to be with you\nIs having the best day of my life\n\nPush the door,I'm home at last\nAnd I'm soaking through and through\nThen you handed me a towel\nAnd all I see is you\nAnd even if my house falls down now\nI wouldn't have a clue\nBecause you're near me and\n\nI want to thank you\nFor giving me the best day of my life\nOh, just to be with you\n\nIs having the best day of my life\n\nI want to thank you\nFor giving me the best day of my life\nOh, just to be with you\nIs having the best day of my life"
